  # pygame
    simple pygame of the snake and apples game
	
# How to play
	At first, you will have a very small snake in the shape of a square at the middle of the screen
	so now you need to make the snake longer as much as possible by eating apples.
	
	To move the snake you use the (up, down, right , and left) arrow keys.
	it's okay if the snake moved byond the borders of the screen. 
	but be careful the snake will come out from the opposite border of the screen :)

	Have fun... 
# Note
	the game is still under development and is not finished yet.
